# Class 6-Security and Networking Concepts

## 1. Micro USB Port
- A **common physical connector** used for charging and data transfer.
- Found in older smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded boards like Raspberry Pi (older models).

---

## 2. Data Exploitation
- **Definition:** The process of using security vulnerabilities to **gain unauthorized access** or **control over data**.
- **Examples:**
  - Exploiting weak passwords.
  - Injecting malicious code into applications.
- **Goal:** Steal, modify, or destroy sensitive information.

---

## 3. SSH (Secure Shell)
- A **network protocol** that allows **secure remote communication** between devices.
- **Uses:**
  - Remote login to servers.
  - Secure file transfer (SCP/SFTP).
- **Security:** Encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping.

---

## 4. Low Privilege User
- Account with **limited permissions**.
- Can only perform basic actions and access allowed files.
- Reduces risk if account is compromised.

---

## 5. Root User
- The **superuser account** with **full administrative rights**.
- Can modify any file, install/uninstall programs, and change system settings.
- **Warning:** Root access must be used carefully to avoid breaking the system.

---

## 6. Privilege Escalation
- **Definition:** The process of **gaining higher-level permissions** than intended.
- **Types:**
  - **Vertical:** Gaining root/admin access from a low privilege account.
  - **Horizontal:** Accessing another user’s account with similar privileges.
- **Prevention:** Apply security patches, use strong authentication, and enforce least privilege.

---

## 7. Bash Script
- A **text file** containing a sequence of commands for the **Bash shell**.
- **Uses:**
  - Automating repetitive tasks.
  - Running server maintenance routines.
- **File extension:** `.sh`

---

## 8. SOC (Security Operations Center)
- **Definition:** A **centralized team and facility** for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats.
- **Functions:**
  - Real-time threat monitoring.
  - Incident response.
  - Vulnerability management.
- **Goal:** Keep an organization’s IT infrastructure secure.
